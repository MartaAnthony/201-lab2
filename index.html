      <h2>Bio</h2>

      <p>I was born in Poland, raised on a fat dose of pierogis and other delicious concoctions of potatoes, cabbage, and pickled everything. I studied both in Poland and in France, then followed my heart and ended up living in the United States â€“ starting in Oklahoma, then Hawaii, and finally, Seattle. </p>

      <h2>Education</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>MA in French Language and Literature from University of Wroclaw</li>
        <li>BA in Teaching French as a Foreign Language from University of Zielona Gora</li>
        <li>Certificate in Digital Photography from University of Washington</li>
      </ul>

      <p>During my time in college, I had the opportunity to study at University of Caen and at Blaise Pascal University in Clermont-Ferrand, France, as an exchange student. Fun times.</p>

      <h2>Professional Experience</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Recruiter at Gravity Payments</li>
        <li>Listing Coordinator at Keller Williams</li>
        <li>Freelance Portrait Photographer</li>
        <li>International Program Coordinator at the University of Zielona Gora</li>
        <li>Program Coordinator at the City Hall in Zielona Gora</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Goals</h2> 

      <p>After many roles in various industries, I decided to search for a more creative, yet intellectually engaging and logical outlet. I am currently studying the foundations of software development, and I hope to break into the tech world by the end of this year. Programming is an extension of my early adulthood passion of learning foreign languages, and fits perfectly with my love of creating.</p>
