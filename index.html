      <h2>Bio</h2>

      <p>I was born in Poland, raised on a fat dose of pierogis and other delicious concoctions of potatoes, cabbage, and pickled everything. I studied both in Poland and in France, then followed my heart and ended up living in the United States â€“ starting in Oklahoma, then Hawaii, and finally, Seattle. </p>

      <h2>Education</h2>

      <p>I've studied French Language and Literature in Poland, and I earned a Masters Degree from University of Wroclaw. During my time in college, I had the opportunity to study at University of Caen and at Blaise Pascal University in Clermont-Ferrand, France, as an exchange student. This was my language learning phase, and a time when I met my future husband. Years later, I also got a Certificate in Digital Photography from University of Washington. </p>

      <h2>Professional Experience</h2>

      I started my professional life in my hometown in Poland, working administrative and program management jobs in international offices at the Town Council and the University. After moving the continents (for love and adventure), I learned photography and dabbled in family portrait photography. Then I revamped the processes of real estate office in Seattle, and finally became a corporate recruiter in a company providing credit card processing services to small companies. 

      <h2>Goals</h2> 

      <p>After many roles in various industries, I decided to search for a more creative, yet intellectually engaging and logical outlet. I am currently studying the foundations of software development, and I hope to break into the tech world by the end of this year. Programming is an extension of my early adulthood passion of learning foreign languages, and fits perfectly with my love of creating.</p>
